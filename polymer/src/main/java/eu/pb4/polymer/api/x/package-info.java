/**
 * "With great power comes great responsibility"
 *
 * All internal magic/apis that I decided are good enough for others to use, while not really wanting to promote them, are here.
 *
 * Intended only for really specific use cases and power users (aka me :tiny_potato:)
 * These can be heavily incompatible in case of multiple mods using them at the same time.
 * But also allows for things otherwise hard to do. Use with care and only if you need it.
 *
 * They also have way less validation and might be unstable, so keep that in mind
